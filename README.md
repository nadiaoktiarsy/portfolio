# About me
Hi! I'm Okti, and currently learning data science since I have been having this interest since I was working in an architecture firm in Jakarta. This is surprising because **my interest in architecture and urban planning, is now growing a new interst: Data Science**. It has been taking for more than 4 years to grow my interest in data science (espeically related with urban planning).

The journey of being a data scientist was started when I was studying in The University of Tokyo. I was taking a class about Transportation Analysis, and I had to use R language for the first time, and found that learning data science is intersting because we can predict and analyze data with many methodologies. Hence, I decided to focus more about data science in the University and also joined data science training from Hacktiv8. 

# Portfolio summary
This repository is the collection of my works, and school assignments. This portfolio will show some progress from the beginning of data science study either in the University and training from Hacktiv8.
1. The first part of portfolio will be about **the basic data science** I learned, especially how to code mainly using python on notebook.
2. The second part will be about **Machine Learning**, sucha as Regression and Classification. Moreover, I will add another work with a different language, R.
3. The third part is about **Deep Learning**: Artifical Neural Network and Deep Neural Network, and finally about the Sentiment Analysis based on Natural Language Processing (NLP).
